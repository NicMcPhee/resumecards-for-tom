For my Division III Captstone project I adapted Ödön von Horváth’s novel
_Youth without God_ into a four episode serial play, [staging each of the
four episodes across
the 2015-16 school year](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAorX3gJPZvP2zTPIkN5mw).
Each episode had different
directorial teams, different casts, and were staged in different
non-traditional spaces on campus.
